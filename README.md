###Impress your friends by making completely useless files even more useless by converting them to pyg latin!!!

This project is a command line utility that can take the contents of a file, translate it to pyg latin, and output it to another file. Why on earth anyone would want to do this, is beyond me. Why on earth anyone would want to program this, is also beyond me. 

That being said, it works kinda sorta, so install it and give it a whirl. Better yet, fork it, enhance it, and make a pr. 

## Installation

Install tool globally

	$npm install -g pyggy

Usage
	
	$pyggy -f ./tests/test.txt -d ./tests/test-pyg.txt

	$pyggy --help

* -f --file
	* the file you would like to convert

* -d --destination
	* the file you want to write the pyg latin to.
